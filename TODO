Features:
	Near-term:
		[DONE] Non-transparent operation
		SNI support
		Reasonable default options for: dhgroup, ecdhcurve, and ciphers
		More DH groups
		[DONE] Stop spawning children if spare children are constantly failing
		[DONE] Better robustness with RSA server:
			[DONE] ping it from child to make sure it started OK
			[DONE] if it terminates, terminate the child too with an error
		[DONE] Enforce max handshake time

	Medium-term:
		Flexible configuration of backend address: route different SNIs/local addresses to different backends
			List of local addresses (:: for all) mapped to list of:
				SNI name
				Key + cert
				Backend address (:: for same as local address in transparent mode)
		Support listening on specific addresses
		Logging (syslog probably)
		Better reporting of errors that happen in children, esp configuration errors
		Support custom DH params
		Better handle SSL shutdown edge cases
	
	Long-term:
		dynamic UIDs
			with cgroups so we can kill them off
		seccomp filter

Meta:
	Document transparent mode
	Test on non-Linux
	[DONE] Legalese
	[DONE] README
	[DONE] Debian packaging
	[DONE] Man page
	[DONE] Web page
	[DONE] Mailing lists

Internal improvements:
	Switch to C++11
	Use RAII more extensively to avoid leaks (though leaks currently only happen if there's an error, and we terminate on error anyways)
	Use structs/classes instead of global variables
	Use enum for key server commands
