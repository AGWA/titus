Place titus config files, with filenames ending in .conf, in /etc/titus.
For an example configuration file, see /usr/share/doc/titus/examples, or
consult the titus(8) man page.

A particular instance of titus can be started/stopped/restarted with:

	/etc/init.d/titus start|stop|restart name

where name is the name of the configuration file _without_ .conf.

By default, all configurations in /etc/titus are launched on system
boot, but this behavior can be changed by editing /etc/default/titus.
